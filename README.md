## Introduction

Several [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)-based applications operate in a very similar manner, particularly management systems. Management System Builder intends to exploit this fact and allow users to create elementary management systems with CRUD functionality, database connectivity and abstraction and other features like email autoresponder and offline payment desk without writing a single line of code.

## How it Works

### 1. Define entities
  > An entity may be defined as a thing capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified. An entity is an abstraction from the complexities of a domain. When we speak of an entity, we normally speak of some aspect of the real world that can be distinguished from other aspects of the real world.
  
  For example, in a library management system, books and subscribers can be considered entities.
  
### 2. Define datafields

Unique attributes of a given entity. In the above mentioned example, datafields for the entity book can be book title, author, publication house, etc.

### 3. Generate code

Given the entities and their corresponding datafields, CRUD code for each entity will be generated. Database tables for each entity are also generated by querying the connected MySQL database. GUI code is also generated for home page, about us page and for each CRUD operation corresponding to every entity. All this code is then packaged along with the dependencies in a JAR file. 

## Requirements

- Java version 8 or higher. See [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for install instructions.

## Installation

### Get it up & running

- Download our latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yashrajkakkad/ManagementSystemBuilder/releases) section.
- Unzip the downloaded zip file.
- Execute the included jar file `ManagementSystemBuilder.jar`.

### Building the source code

- Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yashrajkakkad/ManagementSystemBuilder.git
cd ManagementSystemBuilder
```
- Build all the classes. Gradle is our build system. See [here](https://gradle.org/install/) for install instructions.
```sh
gradle build
```
- Execute the JAR file
```sh
java -jar build/libs/ManagementSystemBuilder.jar
```

## Usage

### Setting up the database (MySQL database)

- You'll be prompted on the first run to setup the database details.
- Enter the host address, database name, username and password.
- Default values point to a MySQL database running on localhost. You can easily set that up using [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows only) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

### Defining the entities

- Enter each entity and define datafields for each of them.

### Defining the datafields

- Enter name of each datafield and define its datatype.
- The first datafield entered will act as the primary key of that entity's database table.

### Defining the GUI Panels

- The options "Add", "Update", "Delete" and "View" will allow you to create a GUI panel for the corresponding option for a particular entity.
- Select the appropriate options for each entity you've defined.

### Other Details

- Draft a message that will be shown in the "About Us" section of your generated app.
- Provide an email address where your users can send feedback.

### Generate the system

- Once all the steps are completed, you can run your generated application on a single click.
- That will execute a script to build your application and then execute the generated .jar file.
- The source code for the generated application can be found in `generated/your_system_name`.
